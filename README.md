This script based on Kim Naim Lesmer portcheck. In the FreeBSD port tree, this port was deprecate due no more public distfiles (http://www.freshports.org/ports-mgmt/portcheck/). Basically, this script fetch to updated port tress, check need-for-upgrade ports, then check if a port has vulnerabilities.
